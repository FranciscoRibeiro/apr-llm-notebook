# APR LLM Tutorial

## Important
<u>**This repository is currently being updated to support OpenAI's current API and provided models.**</u>

## Explanation
The notebook was initially developed with 3 sets of exercises. Each set used:
- CodeBERT
- CodeGPT
- OpenAI's GPT-3

Currently, GPT-3 is deprecated. OpenAI no longer provides it. As such, the last set of exercises does not work. GPT-3 was used in the last set of exercises to demonstrate what more capable models can accomplish and the kind of prompting they allow us to do.

Since the creation of this tutorial, models have become increasingly conversational. As such, interaction with these models has changed. Therefore, it is not enough to replace GPT-3 with a similar model, as the way we build our prompts has also changed. Arguably, interaction was also simplified as a consequence. Still, the adaptation takes work as the tutorial's general background architecture needs considerable modifications. Furthermore, the new techniques need to be concisely yet effectively explained in the notebook's text.

We believe our efforts are best put into adapting those exercises to use more recent versions, like GPT-4 or GPT-4-based models.
